Disclaimer: I'm doing this in my already minimal spare time. Might still take some time to finish. Any errors/bugs to: nefertem(at)arcor(dot)de Please add "HH_FanMade" as the email's subject, as other emails will be ignored. I'll take care of tham asap.

To use the files: Browse to the BattleScribe data files on your device and create a folder ("30k 9th" or whatever). Copy the files into the folder and you should be good. Have fun, stay healthy!
