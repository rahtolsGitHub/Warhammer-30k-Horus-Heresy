Known Issues:

General:
When choosing >= 2 Detachments in the army you have to manually delete/add some Army Setup Entries; also the Legion has to be chosen in every detachment (no validation, if the army compoisition only allows one Legion for the whole army).

Lord of War: No validation, if <= 25% total points

Rites of War
No validation in roster if FORTIFICATIONS/SUPER-HEAVY (AUXILLARY) are taken with certain Rites of War
Orphans of Betrayal: Not validating if >= HEAVY than TROOPS
Outcast Sons: Not validating if >= ELITE than TROOPS
PotL, Fury of the Ancients, Skyhunter Phallanx: Able to choose another Legion with 2+ detachments (may only have one)
Sacrificial Offering: Militia as "Faction-Bedingung" @ Patrol Detachment not yet implemented	
Skyhunter Phallanx: All VEHICLES must have FLY; unit without the BIKER and FLY keywords must be transported in a VEHICLE not yet implemented

Army Special Rules:
Some special rules allow a unit to change certain wargear with a Legion specific one. This is not yet implemented
Disclaimer: I'm doing this in my already minimal spare time. Might still take some time to finish. Any errors/bugs to: nefertem(at)arcor(dot)de Please add "HH_FanMade" as the email's subject, as other emails will be ignored. I'll take care of tham asap.

To use the files: Browse to the BattleScribe data files on your device and create a folder ("30k 9th" or whatever). Copy the files into the folder and you should be good. Have fun, stay healthy!
