# Warhammer-30k-Horus-Heresy
BattleScribe data for the game

BS data file....in progress. Slowly but steady

Actual status: Made all units fit the updated 9th edition.

To do's:

    implement the Legion specific units and benefits
    implement the Rites of War (actually playing around, only Angel's Wrath as a test working)
    add the other armies (Mechanicum,...)

Disclaimer: I'm doing this in my already minimal spare time. Might still take some time to finish. Any errors/bugs to: nefertem(at)arcor(dot)de Please add "HH_FanMade" as the email's subject, as other emails will be ignored. I'll take care of tham asap.

To use the files: Browse to the BattleScribe data files on your device and create a folder ("30k 9th" or whatever). Copy the files into the folder and you should be good. Have fun, stay healthy!
