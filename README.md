# Warhammer-30k-Horus-Heresy
BattleScribe data for the game

BS data file....in progress. Slowly but steady

Actual status: Made all units fit the updated 9th edition.

To do's:

    implement all the Rites of War (actually only up to Orbital Assault implemented, working on Orphans of Betryal and rest)
    implement the Legion specific units and benefits
    add the other armies (Mechanicum,...)

Disclaimer: I'm doing this in my already minimal spare time. Might still take some time to finish. Any errors/bugs to: nefertem(at)arcor(dot)de Please add "HH_FanMade" as the email's subject, as other emails will be ignored. I'll take care of tham asap.

To use the files: Browse to the BattleScribe data files on your device and create a folder ("30k 9th" or whatever). Copy the files into the folder and you should be good. Have fun, stay healthy!
